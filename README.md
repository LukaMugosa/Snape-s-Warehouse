# -Snapes's Potions Warehouse

This is my **homework project**. The task was to make a web app for Professor Snape so he can store his potions in a database.**He needs to store potions,recipes and ingredients**, and also useres can registrate to use the database.The app is divided in 2 parts-**Snape's account and users account**.

# Snape's account

-So i divided the app so Snape has something like an *admin panel*. When he logs in on his *home page* he sees suggested potions by user and then he can decide if he wants to add it to the database.He has a page for seeing useres who have registrated to the app.In that page he can activate or deactivate certain users.On page *'Potions'* he sees a table of potions with names,pictures,descriptions and recipes.He also sees the current quantity of bootles of that potion.The app isn't finished but i have in mind to add a search bar to the *Potions* page using ajax so he can retrive them fast.I haven't finished the *create potion* and *add potion* pages but the backend part is almost done.

# Users' account

User has 3 pages.When he logs in he sees a form tu suggest a potion to Snape. The remainig two pages are *potions* and *create potion*.The page *Potion* is basicly the same as professors Snape's and *Create Potion* is not ready, in my mind it should retrive searched potion, show all ingredients, adds them to the cart and makes a potion. When it makes a potion the quantity of bottles increments, and the quantity of ingredients decrements for the amount of used ingredients.


I have also added a registration page in which if a user wants to registrate, he can do that by signing a simple form. All the issues that can occure in signig that form are processed on the server side.
